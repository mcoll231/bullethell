# bullethell

Alergic to colors
dodge all the falling colors for as long as you can.
arrows or wasd to move, try to avoid the bullets that fall down from the trees under the light of the moon

i used a randomiser engine to make bullets randomly spawn and float down like leaves, the moon is coded to move left and right at set intervals.
